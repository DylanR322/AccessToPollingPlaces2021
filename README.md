# Access to Polling Places Paper

This paper was completed in December of 2021 for a class at the University of Pennsylvania, PSCI 338: Statistical Methods in Political Science. It explores access to polling places in states across the South and Midwest to see if access to polling places is affected by partisanship and/or demographic characteristics. The assignment was to do a research project on an issue in Political Science, modeled off a traditional political science paper. 

The Code and Data folders contain all of the code and data needed to produce figures and values used in the paper. First, run the DataCleaning Script, then the FinalAnalysis&Tables Script. The DataCleaning script draws on data from the Data Folder, and outputs into the CleanData folder. The FinalAnalysis&Tables script draws on data from the Clean Data Folder and outputs into the Visuals Folder. The PDF is the final paper that was written based on the analysis and figures!

When running the R Scripts, make sure you change the working directory so it directs to where you have downloaded the files onto your computer.  For example, setwd("~/downloads/psci-338-project/Data/")
